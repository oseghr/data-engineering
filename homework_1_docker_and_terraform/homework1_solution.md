# Solution: Homework 1 - Docker & SQL


## Question 1. Understanding Docker images

Run docker with the `python:3.13` image. Use an entrypoint `bash` to interact with the container.

What's the version of `pip` in the image?

## Steps:
```bash
# confirm docker version:
docker --version

# create the docker image:
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash python:3.13

# update packages:
apt update

# confirm python version:
python --version

# check pip version:
pip --version
```
## Answer: 
- pip 25.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pip (python 3.13)


## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

## Answer:
- db:5432

## Question 3. Counting short trips

For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a `trip_distance` of less than or equal to 1 mile?

- 7,853
- 8,007
- 8,254
- 8,421


## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with `trip_distance` less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2025-11-14
- 2025-11-20
- 2025-11-23
- 2025-11-25


## Question 5. Biggest pickup zone

Which was the pickup zone with the largest `total_amount` (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?

- East Harlem North
- East Harlem South
- Morningside Heights
- Forest Hills


## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`. We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

- JFK Airport
- Yorkville West
- East Harlem North
- LaGuardia Airport


## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform.
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](../../../01-docker-terraform/terraform/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Terraform Workflow

Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for:
1. Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
2. Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
3. Remove all resources managed by terraform`

Answers:
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
- teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
- terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm



## Question 3. Counting short trips

For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a `trip_distance` of less than or equal to 1 mile?

## Answer
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as trip_count
 FROM nyc_taxi
 WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2025-11-01'
   AND lpep_pickup_datetime < '2025-12-01'
   AND trip_distance <= 1;
```
- RESULT: 8,007



## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with `trip_distance` less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

Use the pick up time for your calculations.
## Answer
```sql
SELECT trip_distance, lpep_pickup_datetime
 FROM nyc_taxi
 WHERE trip_distance <= 100
 ORDER BY trip_distance DESC;
 ```
```psql
 trip_distance | lpep_pickup_datetime |
|---------------+----------------------|
| 88.03         | 2025-11-14 15:36:27 
```
- SOLUTION: 2025-11-14



## Question 5. Biggest pickup zone

Which was the pickup zone with the largest `total_amount` (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?

## Answer
```sql
SELECT nt."PULocationID", sum(nt.fare_amount) as total_amount, tl."LocationID", tl."Zone"
  FROM nyc_taxi nt
  LEFT JOIN taxi_lookup tl
  ON nt."PULocationID" = tl."LocationID"
 WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2025-11-18'
   AND lpep_pickup_datetime <  '2025-11-19'
 GROUP BY nt."PULocationID", tl."LocationID",tl."Zone" 
 ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```
```psql
 PULocationID | total_amount       | LocationID | Zone                              |
|--------------+--------------------+------------+-----------------------------------|
| 74           | 6555.319999999997  | 74         | East Harlem North                 |
```
- SOLUTION: East Harlem North
